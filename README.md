Critical Improvements Needed
1. Publications Section - Needs Status Clarity

"Submitted" papers need journal/conference names and dates
Add DOI links or arXiv links where available
Distinguish between peer-reviewed and submitted work more clearly
Consider separating into "Published" and "Under Review" subsections

2. Research Experience - Lacks Quantifiable Impact
Your thesis work mentions "Led to multiple publications" but doesn't show:

Specific performance metrics (accuracy, returns, Sharpe ratio for trading algorithms)
Dataset sizes or computational requirements
Novel contributions vs. baseline methods
Any code repositories or reproducibility artifacts

3. Academic Projects Need More Depth
Current descriptions are too brief. Add:

Specific algorithms/architectures used
Quantitative results (e.g., "achieved 95% win rate" for ping-pong agent)
Collaboration details (solo vs. team projects)
GitHub links to code

4. Professional Experience - Wrong Focus
For academic applications, your industry work should emphasize:

Research aspects over implementation details
Publications or patents resulting from work
Novel algorithmic contributions
Cut 50% of the technical implementation details

5. Missing Critical Sections
Add:

Research Statement (2-3 sentences at the top about your research vision)
Preprints/Working Papers section
Conference Presentations (talks, posters)
Relevant Coursework (your 4.0 GPA deserves to show advanced courses)
Research Interests should be more specific (e.g., "Model-free RL for financial applications" not just "Reinforcement Learning")

6. Teaching Experience - Undersold

Mention any course development contributions
Student feedback scores if available
Any innovative teaching methods
Consider moving this higher for teaching-focused positions

7. Skills Section - Too Generic
Replace the current list with:

Research methodologies you're proficient in
Specific RL algorithms you've implemented from scratch
Dataset types you've worked with
Computational resources you can leverage (GPU clusters, etc.)

8. Structural Issues

The highlights banner feels more corporate than academic
Remove phone number (email is sufficient)
Add Google Scholar/ResearchGate/ORCID links
The gradient purple theme is nice but consider a more conservative color for academia

Quick Wins

Add metrics everywhere: "Taught 80+ students" → "Taught 80+ students with 4.5/5.0 average course rating"
Reorder sections: Education → Research Interests → Publications → Research Experience → Teaching → Industry Experience
Expand thesis description: Add 2-3 bullet points about novel contributions
Create a two-sentence research statement right under your name
